It is a popular library, all of its code is open source. A strong, developed community helps you deal with complexity faster, especially when it comes to challenging projects. Despite all the advantages, this tool has features that in some cases can become disadvantages. To prevent this from happening, you need to understand when React is needed, where its use is appropriate, and where it is not.  
  
## 1.Multipurpose  
One of the key features of React is its versatility. This library can be used on SERVER. recomended Next.js and mobile platforms using React Native.
Or even Gatsby, is the best way to build static sites with React.
  
## 2.Declarative approach  
Another important feature of the library is declarativeness. Using React, the developer describes how the interface components look in different states. A declarative approach shortens the code and makes it understandable.
  
## 3.Components  
React is component-based, which is another key feature of the library. Each component returns a part of the user interface with its own state. By combining the components, the programmer creates a complete web application interface.  
  
## 4.JSX  
  
An important feature of React is its use of JSX. This is a JavaScript syntax extension that is useful for describing an interface. JSX is similar to HTML, but it is still JavaScript. JSX example can be seen below:  
  
## 5.Vittual DOM most important thing in React  
An important feature of React is its use of the Virtual DOM (Virtual DOM). The virtual DOM is an object that stores information about the state of an interface. When the state changes, for example after submitting a form or clicking a button, React calculates the difference between the old and new state. The library then renders the new state. Using the virtual DOM allows the library to efficiently update the real DOM.
  
While React doesnâ€™t come with the same tooling as Angular or Vue, it makes the tradeoff for flexibility. You can mix and match any library you want with React. With the growth of the ecosystem, we now have CLI tools like Create React App and Next.js.  
  
### Facebook. 
It uses React partially, but also in the PC version and in the mobile application.  
  
### Instagram. 
In such a popular application, the reactant plays a huge role. From the ability to determine the location to the accuracy of the search functionality, this is often done in React.  
  
### Netflix. 
It is most actively used on the Gibbon platform. The main function becomes the ability to adjust the settings for TVs with low performance. The library helps speed up loading and improve performance - this is where programmers knew exactly what React js was for.  
  
### Yahoo! Mail.
Thanks to Facebook, these services have become streamlined in terms of architecture. It took a lot of updates to get the desired result: easy debugging, low entry level, independently deployable components. React suited them because of a number of its properties: one-way data flow, the ability to use the virtual DOM, an active community.

### WhatsApp 
- the specialists of this service decided to use React to create user interfaces.  
  
### Dropbox. 
In the wake of the popularity of the library, it began to be used for this site.  
  
In conclusion, remember that any tool is good for a specific purpose. So is the react - it has a number of advantages, but also its disadvantages. Nevertheless, if the specialist knows the features and applies the tool appropriately, the disadvantages can be easily come over. The main thing for the developer is not to fall into fanaticism - in the choice of technology, start from the situation, tasks and needs of the client, and not from personal preferences.
